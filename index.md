Japanese has about **50 letters**.

{% include hiragana-table.html class="ej-initial" %}

---

Why so many? Because each letter indicates a combination of a consonant ...

{% include hiragana-table.html class="ej-consonant" %}

---

... and a vowel. 10 consonants × 5 vowels makes **50 sounds**.

{% include hiragana-table.html class="ej-vowel" %}

---

Although Japanese has 3 kinds of characters, _**Hiragana (ひらがな)**_, _**Katakana (カタカナ)**_ and _**Kanji (漢字)**_, all of them represents those **50 sounds**.

    <th colspan="6">All of the followings are pronounced like <code>ya ma</code> which means "mountain"</th>

What you see is _**Hiragana (ひらがな)**_. _Hiragana_ is the easiest and it is possible to write all Japanese words and sentences by _Hiragana_. So it is good to learn _Hiragana_ first.

{% include hiragana-table.html %}

---

There are some exceptions about the sounds.

{% include hiragana-table.html class="ej-ex-sound" %}

---

<a name="hiragana-ex-sound" class="ej-advanced"></a>

`si`, `ti`, `tu` and `wo` are represented as a combination of a large and a small characters.

{% include hiragana-ex-sound-table.html %}

---

<a name="ti" class="ej-advanced"></a>

Small characters are pronounced quickly. For example, quick `て(te)` and `い(i)` sounds nearly `てぃ(ti)`.

{% include hiragana-ex-sound-table.html class="ej-ti" %}

---

<a name="tu" class="ej-advanced"></a>

Be aware that `とぅ(tu)` is not pronounced like `tu [tjú]` but like a combination of the consonant `t` and the vowel `u`, similar to `[t]`.

{% include hiragana-ex-sound-table.html class="ej-tu" %}

---

<a name="blank" class="ej-advanced"></a>

There are blank cells in the table of the 50 letters.

{% include hiragana-table.html class="ej-blank" %}

---

<a name="blank-available" class="ej-advanced"></a>

Those sounds are also represented as a combination of a large and a small characters.

{% include hiragana-table.html class="ej-blank-avaibale" %}

---

<a name="we" class="ej-advanced"></a>

`うぇ(we)` is not pronounced like "we" but "we" of "west".

{% include hiragana-table.html class="ej-we" %}

---

<a name="blank-unavaibale" class="ej-advanced"></a>

The sounds of `yi` and `wu` are rarely used (also in English). Japanese does not have common representations of them.

{% include hiragana-table.html class="ej-blank-unavaibale" %}

---

How about other consonants like `b`, `d`, `g`, `p` and `z`? No such sounds in the table.

{% include hiragana-table.html %}

---

Characters with a `゛` on their upper right corner changes the consonants from `h`, `k`, `s` and `t` to `b`, `g`, `z` and `d` respectively.

{% include hiragana-table.html class="ej-dakuon" %}

---

Although Japanese people think these conversions are natural and consistent, I guess it is unclear for non-native speakers. It can be interpreted that `゛`s adds some vibrating sounds. It is similar to `s`-to-`z` conversions in English like book**s** (`[s]`) and boy**s** (`[z]`).

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>h → b</th>
    <td>は(ha) → ば(ba)</td>
    <th>k → g</th>
    <td>か(ka) → が(ga)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>s → z</th>
    <td>さ(sa) → ざ(za)</td>
    <th>t → d</th>
    <td>た(ta) → だ(da)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

`じ(ji)`, `ぢ(ji)`, `づ(zu)` are pronounced irregularly as well as `し(shi)`, `ち(chi)`, `つ(tsu)`.

{% include hiragana-table.html class="ej-dakuon-ex-sound" %}

---

<a name="hiragana-ex-sound-dakuon" class="ej-advanced"></a>

`zi`, `di` and `du` are represented as a combination of large and small characters as well as `si`, `ti`, and `tu`.

{% include hiragana-ex-sound-table.html class="ej-dakuon" %}

---

How about `p`? Upper right `゜` change `h` to `p`.

{% include hiragana-table.html class="ej-handakuon" %}

---

<a name="hiragana-extra" class="ej-advanced"></a>

`f`, `j`, `v`, `ch`, `sh` and other consonants are represented in the following way. Small letters of `や(ya)`, `ゆ(yu)` and `よ(yo)` are used for `[ʃ]` and `[j]` sounds. Japanese lacks `th`. So Japanese people are not good at identifying the sounds between `s`, `sh` and `th`. `ji` is weakened in the table because it has been already shown above. `fu`, `[tʃi]`, `[ʃi]`, `[hji]` and `[fja]` to `[fjo]` except `[fju]` are rare and absent in the table.

{% include hiragana-extra-table.html %}

---

<a name="r-and-l" class="ej-advanced"></a>

How about `l`? Strictly speaking, the consonant of `ら(ra)`, `り(ri)`, `る(ru)`, `れ(re)` and `ろ(ro)` is not `r` but intermediate one between `r` and `l`.

{% include hiragana-table.html class="ej-r-and-l" %}

---

`お` and `を` have same sound `o`. `を` is a special character to make object words. A noun followed by `を` is an object word in Japanese.

{% include hiragana-table.html class="ej-o-and-wo" %}

---

A noun followed by `は` make a subject as well. In such cases, `は` is pronounced like not `ha` but `wa`, same as `わ(wa)`.

{% include hiragana-table.html class="ej-ha-and-wa" %}

---

`ん` is a special character of the sound `n` in Japanese. No Japanese words starts with `ん`. So in _shiritori_, Japanese word-chain games, someone who says a word which ends with `ん` loses.

{% include hiragana-table.html class="ej-n" %}

---

_**Katakana (カタカナ)**_ has also 50 characters like _Hiragana_. _Katakana_ charactrs are used to approximate foreign words.

{% include katakana-table.html %}

---

For example, "pen" in English is `ペン (pe + n)` in Japanese. "arbeit" in German is `アルバイト (a + ru + ba + i + to)` in Japanese. There are a lot of Japanese words derived from foreign languages. They are usually written in _Katakana_.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>pen (English)</th>
    <td>ペン (pe + n)</td>
    <th>arbeit (German)</th>
    <td>アルバイト (a + ru + ba + i + to)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>gom (Dutch)</th>
    <td>ゴム (go + mu)</td>
    <th>炒飯 [chǎo fàn] (Chinese)</th>
    <td>チャーハン (cha + [ ː ] + ha + n)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

The third kinds of characters in Japanese are _**Kanji (漢字)**_, also known as Chinese characters. There are **thousands of _Kanji_** because each _Kanji_ works like a word in English. For example `山 (yama)` means "mountain".

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>山 (yama)</th>
    <td>mountain</td>
    <th>川 (kawa)</th>
    <td>river</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>花 (hana)</th>
    <td>flower</td>
    <th>空 (sora)</th>
    <td>sky</td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

Some _Kanji_ have dual, or more, meanings like words. `空 (sora)` is "sky" and `空 (kara)` is empty.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>空 (sora)</th>
    <td>sky</td>
    <th>空 (kara)</th>
    <td>empty</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>角 (kado)</th>
    <td>corner</td>
    <th>角 (tsuno)</th>
    <td>horn</td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

Multiple _Kanji_ also make a word. `動物 (doubutsu)` is "animal" which consist of `動 (dou)` = "move" and `物 (butsu)` = "thing".

<table>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="3">動物 (doubutsu)</th>
    <td colspan="2">animal</td>
    <th rowspan="3">列車 (ressha)</th>
    <td colspan="2">train</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>動 (dou)</th>
    <td>move</td>
    <th>列 (retsu)</th>
    <td>cascade</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>物 (butsu)</th>
    <td>thing</td>
    <th>車 (sha)</th>
    <td>car</td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

As told above, it is possible to write all _Kanji_ in _Hiragana_ instead.

<table>
<tr>
  <th></th>
  <th>Kanji</th>
  <th>Hiragana</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>yama</th>
  <td>山</td>
  <td>やま</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>kawa</th>
  <td>川</td>
  <td>かわ</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>hana</th>
  <td>花</td>
  <td>はな</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>sora</th>
  <td>空</td>
  <td>そら</td>
</tr>
</table>

---

<a name="kanji-and-spaces" class="ej-advanced"></a>

We, Japanese, use _Kanji_ just for readability. Because Japanese sentences usually do not contain spaces between words, it is hard to read sentences written all in _Hiragana_.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4">
      Using <em>Kanji</em> make it easier to separate words
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="4">with Kanji</th>
    <td colspan="3">僕は動物が好きです。</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="3">I like animals.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>僕は</td>
    <td>動物が</td>
    <td>好きです</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I</td>
    <td>animals</td>
    <td>like</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="4">without Kanji</th>
    <td colspan="3">ぼくはどうぶつがすきです。</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="3">I like animals.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ぼくは</td>
    <td>どうぶつが</td>
    <td>すきです</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I</td>
    <td>animals</td>
    <td>like</td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

<a name="homonyms" class="ej-advanced"></a>

Japanese also have various homonyms. _Kanji_ makes it easier to distinguish words.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="4">All of these are <code>きかん (kikan)</code></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>期間</th>
    <td>period</td>
    <th>機関</th>
    <td>engine</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>帰還</th>
